{1}What... what was that?[.6]1
{2}I have no idea, but it gave us a way out of here, so I'm taking it.[1.1]2
{1}Do you know where here is?[.6]3
{2}No, but I can guess it's probably not where I want to be.[.85]4
{1}What's your name, by the way?[.6]5
{2}Benny. You?[.6]6
{1}Call me Benjamin.[.6]-1
{1}This is the only way to go, I suppose.[.85]8
{2}Yeah, and we're taking it.[.6]-1
{2}Something is strange here, the light feels like a wall.[.85]10
{2}You have that problem?[.6]11
{1}No, I have the opposite problem. The shadows feel hard.[.85]12
{3}We'll probably have to work together to get out then.[.6]-1
{1}Whatever that explosion was, it knocked over this plant here.[.6]14
{2}But not much other damage. Strange, huh?[.7]15
{1}Almost as strange as having a plastic plant in a prison facility.[1]-1
{1}There's a set of body armor up here. And a gun.[.85]17
{2}A gun? Grab it, we might have to shoot our way out.[.6]18
{1}What? No way, I don't want to shoot anyo-[.2]19
{1}What on earth?[.6]20
{2}What?[.35]21
{1}The gun is... fused somehow. Melted.[.6]22
{1}That's probably for the best.[.6]23
{2}Speak for yourself. It probably would have been useful.[.85]-1
{3}Stairs down. Probably not where we want to be, huh?[.6]-1
{2}Damn, the door here is sealed. Do you see a way out down there?[.85]26
{1}No, the maintenance tunnel ends here. We'll have to look somewhere else.[.85]27
{3}Excuse me, gentlemen. Perhaps I can assist you?[.75]28
{1}What? Who the hell are you?[.6]29
{3}My name is Eric Layton. I'm the head of this facility. And you two would be.. ah yes.[.75]30
{3}I was visiting with the warden when the incident ocurred, but he is...[.85]31
{3}Indisposed at the moment.[.6]32
{1}What was the incident?[.6]33
{3}Apologies, you're rather quiet down there. What did you say?[.85]34
{2}Benjamin asked what the "incident" was.[.6]35
{3}I'm not sure, but it would appear something went wrong in the ritual chamber.[.9]36
{3}From my understanding, the... thaum flux reached excessive levels. I think.[.85]37
{1}That sounds like magic.[.6]38
{3}Of course. Verlen Enterprises maintains a research branch for the understanding of such things.[.9]39
{2}Whatever. You had no right to pull me out of that jail.[.6]40
{2}Let me leave![.6]41
{1}I would also like to get out of here. I'd rather serve my time in a real jail.[.85]42
{3}While I appreciate the sentiment, gentlemen, the facility has been put into automatic lockdown.[1]43
{3}I can't even leave this office.[.6]44
{3}You'll need to go down to the ritual level's control terminal to release the lockdown.[1.1]45
{3}That will allow anyone trapped to evacuate, so I suppose it's in my authority to let you leave with them.[1.1]46
{2}Damn right. Let's go, Benjamin.[.7]47
{1}Yeah, let's roll.[.7]-1
