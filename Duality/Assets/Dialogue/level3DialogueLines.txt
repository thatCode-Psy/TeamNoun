{1}So we're technically the same person, huh?[.6]1
{2}I could see it.[.6]5
//{1}Nickname versus real name I guess.[.6]3
//{1}Think there was any merit in what that lady said? With the yin and yang side thing?[.8]4
//{2}Well, we do seem pretty different. That might be it.[.6]5
{2}But honestly, who gives a shit? I'm sure we'll have stuff to talk about on the outside,[.85]6
{2}But for now we gotta move. That chick said we only had a few minutes, right?[.6]8
//{1}Yeah, those alarms don't look good.[.6]8
{1}Do... you think we should try to fix ourselves?[.9]9
{2}Gotta make it out of here first.[.6]-1
//{2}Glad to see you made it.[.6]11
//{1}Sorry, that explosion did a number on this place.[.8]12
//{1}Sure made it weird, but I'm glad there was a up.[.6]13
{2}I see the way out ahead. Lets leave this shitty place.[.6]14
{2}And then, we'll fix ourselves. These motherfuckers can't beat us.[.8]15
{1}Yeah![.5]-1
{1}Do you think we have a chance to fix ourselves? Be one person again?[.7]16
{2}Never know until we try, right? We have a lead, we'll figure it out.[.85]17
{1}Maybe without breaking the law this time.[.6]18
{2}Hey, we did what we needed to, and we'll keep doing it. Right?[.8]19
{1}Fair enough! Let's roll.[.7]-1
