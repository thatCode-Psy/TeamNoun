{1}So we're technically the same person, huh?[.6]1
{2}I can see it. We do have nearly the same name.[.6]2
{1}Nickname versus real name I guess.[.6]3
{1}Think there was any merit in what that lady said? With the yin and yang side thing?[.8]4
{2}Well, we do seem pretty different. That might be it.[.6]5
{2}But honestly, who cares? I'm sure we'll have stuff to talk about on the outside,[.85]6
{2}But for now we gotta move. That chick said we only had a few minutes, right?[.6]7
{1}Yeah, those alarms don't look good.[.6]8
{1}Looks like we gotta split up here. I'll see you at the top?[.7]9
{2}See you at the top.[.6]-1
{2}Glad to see you made it.[.6]11
{1}Sorry, that explosion did a number on this place.[.8]12
{1}Sure made it weird, but I'm glad there was a up.[.6]13
{2}Well I see the way out ahead. Lets leave this shitty place.[.6]14
{1}Yeah.[.5]15
{1}Do you think we have a chance to fix ourselves? Be one person again?[.7]16
{2}Never know until we try, right? We have a lead, we'll figure it out.[.85]17
{1}Maybe without breaking the law this time.[.6]18
{2}Hey, we did what we needed to, and we'll keep doing it. Right?[.8]19
{1}Fair enough! Let's roll.[.7]-1
