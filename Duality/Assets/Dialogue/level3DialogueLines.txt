{1}So we're technically the same person, huh?[.5]1
{2}I can see it. We do have nearly the same name.[.5]2
{1}Nickname versus real name I guess.[.5]3
{1}Think there was any merit in what that lady said? With the yin and yang side thing?[.7]4
{2}Well, we do seem pretty different. That might be it.[.]5
{2}But honestly, who cares? I'm sure we'll have stuff to talk about on the outside,[.75]6
{2}But for now we gotta move.[.5]7
{1}Looks like we gotta split up here. I'll see you at the top?[.6]8
{2}See you at the top.[.5]-1
{2}Glad to see you made it.[.5]10
{1}Sorry, that explosion did a number on this place.[.7]11
{1}Sure made it weird, but I'm glad there was a up.[.5]12
{2}Well I see the way out ahead. Lets leave this shitty place.[.5]13
{1}Yeah.[.3]14
{1}Do you think we have a chance to fix ourselves? Be one person again?[.6]15
{2}Never know until we try, right? We have a lead, we'll figure it out.[.75]16
{1}Maybe without breaking the law this time.[.5]17
{2}Hey, we did what we needed to, and we'll keep doing it. Right?[.5]18
{1}Fair enough! Let's roll.[.5]-1
