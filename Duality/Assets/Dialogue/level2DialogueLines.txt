//{2}The stairs down here are broken.[.6]1
//{1}Must have been the, what did he call it? Thaum flux?[.6]2
//{2}Something like that. All Greek to me.[.6]3
//{2}It sounded like he didn't even know.[.6]-1
{1}It's pretty crazy looking down here.[.6]5
//{1}I wonder if people know about this part.[.6]6
//{2}I'd bet no. They definitely did something to magic to us,[.7]7
//{2}And I don't think human experimentation would go over well.[.8]8
//{1}You aren't wrong about that.[.6]-1
{1}Woah.[.6]-1
{2}Holy shit, look at this.[.6]11
{1}I guess that's why Mr.Layton called it the ritual level.[.6]12
{1}I can kind of remember coming here though...[.6]15
//{2}Me too, I remember being led out into the middle there.[.6]14
//{1}Then a brutal headache, and waking up in that cell?[.6]15
{2}Yeah. Those bastards better have a way to undo whatever they did.[.85]16
{1}I wonder what it was they did though.[.6]17
{1}Surely making light or shadow solid couldn't have been the whole point, right?[.85]-1
//{2}No idea.[.6]-1
{2}Ok, now where the hell is this terminal?[.7]20
{3}Hello? Is someone out there?[.85]21
{2}Another person, great. Let me guess, you're trapped in there?[.8]22
{3}Yes, it turns out the karmic imbalance from having too many subjects[.3]23
{3}created a thaumic vacuum that, when it was forced back into equilibirum,[.3]24
{3}irradiated the facility with nearly 14 megathaumiels of magic flux and triggered lockdown.[.8]25
{1}...What?[.6]27
//{2}Yeah, what was all that?[.7]27
{3}My apologies, perhaps that was too deep-wait.[.7]28
{3}You aren't staff members, you're subjects![.7]29
{2}Yeah, rather unfortunately for us. Who are you anyway?[.7]30
{3}I'm Andrea Ellisburg, I'm the head researcher at this facility.[.8]31
{1}Okay then,what the hell did did they do to us here?[.8]32
{3}Well, we were attempting to discern what causes people to commit evil acts[.95]33
{3}The goal was to create a "vaccine for the soul" against those things.[.95]34
{2}...What.[.6]35
{3}To do it, we used a ritual to separate prisoners into "yin" and "yang" halves.[.95]36
{3}I assume you didn't realize you're a mass of plus spin magic energy contained in a minus spin membrane?[.95]37
{3}And the other you is the opposite![.7]38
{1}What on... holy crap![.6]39
{2}Holy shit what the fuck?[.6]40
{3}A usual occurrence. The human mind is remarkably able to ignore things that are "unnatural".[.95]41
{1}Wait, but if you split people in half...[.7]42
{2}...And we were in cells next to each other...[.7]43
{3}Probably, yes. Based on your ambient anima readings, Benjamin Aredoughne?[1]45
//{3}Convicted of burglary, brought here just before the solestice?[.7]45
{1}Well... is there a way you can make us... be a normal person again?[.8]46
{3}Er.[.5]47
{3}Well, no.[.8]48
{2}You motherfuckers.[.7]49
{3}Wait, wait! In theory, if you can find can find a place of sufficient thaumic pressure-[.3]50
{1}In layman's terms, please.[.7]51
{3}Ok... if you can find a sufficiently magical place and be close enough together,[.8]52
{3}The ambient magic could reverse the ritual and "snap" you back to your natural state.[.8]53
{2}I almost don't believe you, but it doesn't matter until we get out of this place.[.7]54
{2}Where's the control terminal?[.6]55
{3}Right past my door. You should be able to take the elevator past it to leave.[.8]56
{3}Be fast, though- Dr. Layton will call enforcers as soon as the lockdown goes down.[.8]57
{3}You'll probably have just a couple minutes to get out.[.7]58
{2}Good enough. Let's go.[.7]-1
{2}Hey, there's a flashlight down here. I'm grabbing it.[.6]60
{1}A portable light source sounds good to me.[.6]-1
{1}There's a... pizza box here.[.6]62
{2}I guess someone had to leave in a hurry, huh?[.6]63
{1}Well, I'll grab it. Maybe I can block light with it.[.7]-1
