What... what was that?
I have no idea, but it gave us a way out of here, so I'm taking it.
Do you know where here is?
No, but I can guess it's probably not where I want to be.
What's your name by the way?
Benny. What about you?
Benjamin.

This is the only way to go, I suppose.
Yeah, and we're taking it.
But, the light parts are like a wall to me.
You have that problem?
No, I have the opposite problem, I think.
Then help me, and I'll help you.

Whatever that explosion was, it knocked over this plant here.
But not much other damage. Strange, huh?

There's a set of armor up here. And a gun.
